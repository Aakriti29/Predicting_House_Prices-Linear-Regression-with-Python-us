# Predicting_House_Prices-Linear_Regression_with_Python

A real estate agent wants to predict housing prices for regions in the USA. He has decided to create a model that allows him to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate at what price the houses should be sold off.
He has some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States, It is all in the data set: USA_Housing.csv.
The data contains the following columns:


•	'Avg. Area Income':                       Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
•	'Avg. Area House Age'                     Avg Age of Houses in same city
•	'Avg. Area Number of Rooms':              Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
•	'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms':           Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
•	'Area Population':                        Population of city house is located in
•	'Price':                                  Price that the house sold at
•	'Address':                                Address for the house
Now using data science skills, solve this problem!

Model used-
The data here is continuous data type and not categorical. Also, to predict housing prices we need to minimize the loss function and punishing the errors.
Therefore, Linear Regression seems to be a good model to work on this problem.
